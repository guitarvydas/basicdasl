The need to refactor a design or to refactor code, should be a red flag.  Refactoring should never be needed in a design which has been decomposed into its most-atomic units.  In other words: refactoring is an epicycle (accidental complexity) caused by too much structure in a design.  Structure can be added in by creating queries ; structure should not be baked into a factbase. (Structure in queries is OK, structure in factbases is bad).
