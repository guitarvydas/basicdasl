=== part 4 ====

In beginning to work on part 5 of this series of essays, I noticed a design bug.

Arrows contain two parts (arrowBegin and arrowEnd) and should be written as pair referencing the containing composite component.

For example
  <outline text="comp “c”">
  ...
    <outline text="arrow c/c  c/e/m" />
  ...

should create a pair, referring to "comp c", and, should create a beginning and end for the pair, like...
comp(id5, c).
arrow(id5,idXXX).
arrowBegin(idXXX,c_c).
arrowEnd(idXXX,[c_c_m]).

(In part 5, we will convert the synonyms "c_c" and "c_c_m" into ids.  This essay is only about fixing the design bug mentioned above).

This bug should be relatively easy to repair.  We need to visit the grasem/glue code for arrow and add another fact.


=== part 5 ====

Let's undo one of the human-input conveniences and normalize the factbase to contain only machine-readable codings.

Currently, arrows contain references to graphical objects.  These references should actually be ids.  These reference are (human-readable) synonyms to (machine-readable) ids.

For example

arrow

arrowBegin(id40, c_a).
